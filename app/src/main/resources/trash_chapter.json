Does it feel weird?”</p><p>On touched her hair at Cale’s question.</p><p>Cale was here looking like Duke Fredo’s son, young master Naru, while On was in her human form.</p><p>However, they both looked different from their usual appearances.</p><p>– I used the dye spell really well!</p><p>Both of their hairs were as red as the sunset.</p><p>“You don’t like it?”</p><p>On immediately shook her head at Cale’s question.</p><p>“I like it, nya!”</p><p>On had subconsciously touched her hair because she liked the fact that it was the same red as Cale’s hair right now.</p><p>But it was also true that her mind was a bit of a mess.</p><p>The Fog Cat Tribe.</p><p>On and Hong were the former tribe leader’s only remaining bloodline.</p><p>However, Hong had been On’s only family member for as long as she could remember.</p><p>The Fog Cat Tribe only ignored them and kept them under surveillance while calling them mutants and trash.</p><p>On had realized that she and Hong were originally the true successors to the leader position because they monitored them despite calling the two of them trash.</p><p>She then found an opening to grab Hong and run away.</p><p>She thought that doing so would be the only way they could survive.</p><p>And now… They were heading over to destroy that Fog Cat Tribe.</p><p>‘…Maybe I’ll be able to learn the details.’</p><p>She might be able to learn more about herself and her brother.</p><p>On frowned.</p><p>It was at that moment.</p><p>“You don’t need to think that hard about it.”</p><p>On raised her head after hearing a stoic yet gentle voice.</p><p>Cale, who was about her height in this appearance, was looking forward.</p><p>“I will take care of everything. On, you just do whatever you want to do. Just think about doing that.”</p><p>Cale recalled the time he met the leader of the Fog Cat Tribe outside Sheritt’s castle in one of the Three Restricted Areas.</p><p>He was recalling the things the leader had said while looking at On and Hong.</p><p>‘They are the last of that bloodline, so they must have been persistent. But I didn’t know they were on Cale Henituse’s side. Is that why we didn’t find them?’</p><p>‘That dirty blood needs to disappear from the world.’</p><p>On had said that the current leader was not her family member.</p><p>‘On and Hong probably has the bloodline of the former tribe leader. The current leader must be the one who pushed the former out of the position.’</p><p>And most likely…</p><p>‘That current leader bastard might have killed On and Hong’s family when he took the position.’</p><p>However, he kept On and Hong alive.</p><p>That was what Cale could not figure out.</p><p>‘Did he keep them alive because they were young?’</p><p>The Fog tribe was known for being the stealthiest tribe among the Cats.</p><p>Being the stealthiest meant that they were the strongest of the Cats.</p><p>Only a select few within the Fog Cat Tribe had special abilities.</p><p>‘Like On and Hong.’</p><p>Cale reached his hand out and ruffled On’s hair.</p><p>“By the way…”</p><p>On could see Cale looking at her.</p><p>“Do you want to go to an academy?”</p><p>On flinched.</p><p>– Human! I don’t want to go to an academy! I am already an extremely strong and great and mighty Dragon! I’m just going to have fun with you, human!

Well, I’ll let you do whatever you want to do. I don’t care whether that is being a slacker or studying in an academy.”</p><p>Cale didn’t think much about it and shared his thoughts before stepping out of the alley.</p><p>He then turned around and motioned to On.</p><p>“Are you not coming?”</p><p>On looked at Cale, who looked like young master Naru right now, before recalling the first time they met Cale when he had given them food.</p><p>It was said that a person goes through three times of luck during their lives.</p><p>On was certain that the day she met Cale was one of those times for her.</p><p>That was the day she had found a family.</p><p>On heard Raon’s voice in her head at that moment.</p><p>– Fighting! And don’t worry! I’m going to be invisible and following you guys! You won’t get hurt!</p><p>On started to smile after hearing her youngest dongsaeng’s bright voice.</p><p>She decided to stop thinking about it.</p><p>She just had to do whatever she wanted to do as Cale had mentioned.</p><p>– …Y, you look like the human when you smile like that! Are you planning on scamming someone? Tell me! I want to do it with you!</p><p>On’s smile grew wider at Raon’s comments before she walked toward Cale.</p><p>The two of them headed for the main gate of the Sez Royal Academy.</p><p>The way there was quite loud.</p><p>“Please step back! His majesty will only appear at 11 am!”</p><p>“Please stay in a single file line! We will kick all of you out if you don’t line up properly!”</p><p>People from the academy and the palace were shouting everywhere.</p><p>It could not be helped.</p><p>“Oh, come on, let me go to the front too!”</p><p>“Move, move!”</p><p>“Wow. Am I really going to see his majesty today? I’ll even be able to hear his speech?”</p><p>“Of course! This is the ideal spot!”</p><p>Numerous citizens of the kingdom were gathered at the plaza and forming a human wave.</p><p>This could not be helped as well.</p><p>“Mommy, his majesty is the strongest in the world, right?”</p><p>“Of course~ our kingdom is the land of knights. Our majesty is also a sword master!”</p><p>“That’s right! He’s the strongest knight!”</p><p>The current king, Bakehe.</p><p>He was a sword master in the land of knights.</p><p>He was a strong king. That was enough for his popularity to rise significantly, but he had done something else five years ago. He had created a new law as soon as he became king.</p><p>‘Create a training center to teach the way of the sword!’</p><p>Training centers where anybody could learn the way of the sword were created throughout the Sez Kingdom.</p><p>The palace covered all fees associated with the facilities.</p><p>‘A person’s identity or whether they are rich or poor will not matter! Make it so that anybody who wishes to learn will be able to learn!’</p><p>‘Send anyone with talent to the Reserve Knights Training Center and give them the support they need to reach their full potential!’</p><p>Current king Bakehe opened a path to becoming a knight for everyone and after five years, there were now people popping up who had gone from orphan to knight, a poor peasant to a successful knight, people here and there who had achieved their dreams.</p><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle"

</script></div><p>“…That’s why he’s quite popular.”</p><p>Cale was smiling while blending in with the crowd of people.</p><p>It was at that moment.</p><p>“Hmm? Why is an academy student over here?”</p><p>A person who made eye contact with Cale mumbled with confusion.</p><p>Cale’s expression instantly changed.</p><p>“Excuse me. Excuse me!”</p><p>He looked anxious and pretended as if he was trying his best to push his way through the crowd with On.</p><p>“One moment, please! We need to get inside! Excuse me, could you please move?!”</p><p>Cale’s pleading voice along with the uniform that symbolized his status as an academy student made everyone turn toward the two of them.</p><p>A knight in armor was frowning as he walked toward them.</p><p>“Over there! The student over there!”</p><p>Cale stopped walking.</p><p>He was smiling internally.</p><p>It would normally require a thorough identity search outside the academy gates to get inside.</p><p>‘But they can’t do that right now.’</p><p>The extremely popular king made it so that the entire plaza up to this gate was full of people.</p><p>It was making it difficult for the academy employees to work.</p><p>‘We would normally have to be checked out by an employee.’</p><p>Unfortunately, that might lead to their ruse being found out.</p><p>“Knight-nim!”</p><p>Cale grabbed the arm of the Sez Kingdom’s knight who was walking toward them with a stiff expression on his face.</p><p>The knight instantly started frowning.</p><p>These could be intruders posing as students.</p><p>“Why are you two-”</p><p>He could not finish speaking.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>A student ID and a doctor’s note were placed in his hand.</p><p>“We came out yesterday because I was sick! We really want to hear today’s speech. Is there any way we can get inside? Please?”</p><p>Cale put his hand on On’s shoulder.</p><p>“My sister’s dream is to become a knight! She really wanted to see his majesty… But she came out with me so that she could take care of me. Is there any way we can get inside?”</p><p>– Human, you’re so good at acting!</p><p>The knight still had a stiff expression while looking at this young boy with a look of desperation on his face, but his wariness was starting to subside.</p><p>‘…He looks very pale.’</p><p>It was because he was looking at a boy who was so pale, something that could not be faked with magic.</p><p>‘He looks young as well.’</p><p>Although magic could be used to dye hair or change different parts of the body, it could not be used to turn an adult into a child.</p><p>‘It is impossible unless there is a Dragon. And if there was a Dragon, it would be here to praise our majesty for his good deeds, not to harm him.’</p><p>He still needed to do this job.</p><p>King Bakehe was the Sez Kingdom’s greatest knight, but this knight still had to protect his liege.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>He headed toward the gate with the sick-looking boy and his sister who was behind him.</p><p>“Please move back!”</p><p>“Back, move back!”</p><p>The gate was also extremely chaotic with people and the knight headed for a tent right outside the gate.</p><p>“These kids-”</p><p>The knight frowned after seeing that there were no employees inside the tent.</p><p>They must have all rushed out to organize the chaos.</p><p>“…There is a lot more activity than usual this year.’</p><p>There were more people than usual trying to push their way forward to see his majesty.</p><p>– Human! Bud’s mercenaries are doing a good job!</p><p>Those troublemakers were all camouflaged mercenaries.</p><p>“Ahem.”</p><p>The knight peeked to the side hoping that Cale wouldn’t have heard his mumbling.</p><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle"

</script></div><p>Cale put on an anxious but bright smile.</p><p>“I think everybody wants to hear his majesty’s speech as close to him as possible like we do. Right?”</p><p>“Yeah, oppa.”</p><p>– Wow! Both of you are so good at acting! Your acting is like the sky while Choi Han’s acting is down on the ground! Choi Han needs to practice!</p><p>The knight nodded his head after seeing this pair of siblings who seemed to have a very good relationship with each other.</p><p>“Alright, let me confirm a few things.”</p><p>He decided to do the check himself instead of waiting for an employee.</p><p>The knight headed over to multiple magic devices in the tent.</p><p>“We will check your student ID, followed by your aura and mana.”</p><p>They normally only used magic devices to check that the student IDs were real.</p><p>But they were checking for aura and mana today as well since the king was giving a speech. They wanted to prepare for any potential trouble.</p><p>“Put your student ID over here.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>Cale placed the ID on the magic device.</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>It naturally said that it was real.</p><p>– Hehe. I slightly twisted the mana in the magic device!</p><p>It was thanks to their Dragon buddy Raon who had done something that was not easy to do at all.</p><p>They easily passed the mana and aura tests as well.</p><p>These two were On and Cale after all.</p><p>Both of their powers had nothing to do with aura or mana.</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>The knight apologetically smiled at the siblings whose IDs were real and had no powers of any kind.</p><p>“Follow me.”</p><p>His tone of voice was much gentler as he led them far away from the main gate to a small side gate.</p><p>He could not open the main gate right now.</p><p>“Hmm? Vice Captain-nim? Who are these kids?”</p><p>The knights guarding the side gate noticed Cale and On and looked toward the knight who brought them here.</p><p>“I checked their identities. Their IDs were real and they didn’t have mana or aura.”</p><p>“Ah. Is that so?”</p><p>Those devices were made by the Sez Kingdom’s greatest mage.</p><p>Nobody would question the magic devices made by a highest-grade Royal Mage.</p><p>Only a Dragon would be able to mess with those devices.</p><p>And what reason would a Dragon have to mess with a small device that checks a student’s academy ID?</p><p>“Alright, head on inside.”</p><p>Cale bowed toward the knight.</p><p>“Thank you very much, knight-nim! I’ll be able to show something great to my sister thanks to your help!”</p><p>The knight chuckled after seeing the joy on the young boy’s face. On thanked the knight as well.</p><p>“Thank you very much, sir. I truly hope I can become a great knight like you, Vice Captain-nim.”</p><p>“Ahem, hem! It’s not like I did much. Hurry on inside! There are less than 30 minutes left!”</p><p>Cale and On respectfully bowed toward the embarrassed Vice Captain shooing them inside as well as the other knights before quickly starting to move.</p><p>“…They really do seem to be students. They’re moving through the extremely complicated pathways of the Sez Royal Academy that are difficult to navigate without a map with no hesitation.”</p><p>“That’s right. They seem to know exactly where they are going.”</p><p>The knights had no way of knowing that Cale had a clear map in his mind.</p><p>– Oh! Human, the buildings are all so pretty!</p><p>The buildings of the Sez Royal Academy were giving off a vintage feel that showed its long history as Raon mentioned.</p><p>However, Cale’s eyes were sharply looking around.</p><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle"

</script></div><p>“It’s over there.”</p><p>He was walking through the complicated streets with no hesitation until he arrived at the Academy’s plaza that was directly in front of the main gate.</p><p>The plaza floor was made of marble.</p><p>There was a high platform in the front.</p><p>“That is the king’s spot.’</p><p>There was an area for the nobles in front of the platform, followed by an area for the chief executives of the academy and then the rows of students.</p><p>The whole area was surrounded by knights and soldiers.</p><p>‘10 minutes.’</p><p>There were only 10 minutes left until the speech now.</p><p>“Hmm? Who are you guys?”</p><p>The knight in the rear frowned at them and Cale quickly bowed.</p><p>“I’m sorry, sir! We went to the restroom-”</p><p>“Shut it and hurry up and get in line!”</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>Cale grabbed On’s hand and stood at the back of the row of first-year students as if that had been his original spot.</p><p>“Stand in front of me.”</p><p>“…Okay.”</p><p>On stood in front of Cale and Cale looked around.</p><p>He heard Raon’s voice at that moment.</p><p>– Human! The Dragons have infiltrated with no problem!</p><p>Raon’s report continued.</p><p>– Grandpa Ron and Beacrox have made it in as well! The Molan household members are all here!</p><p>– Bud said that he made it through a dog hole so you don’t need to worry about him!</p><p>One, two.
